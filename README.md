This project is a simple demo using the JSON Web Token integrated with Spring Boot and Spring Security.
Angular 2 is used for the authentication. Credits to Vladimir Stankovic, his article about integration with Spring was
an incredible help however I have rewritten a large portion of his example to follow better code practise, 
thank you very much. Nandtel for your Gradle spring boot angular 2 starter, made the starting of this
project incredibly easy.
